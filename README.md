# Deep-Learning-Mini-Course
A whistlestop tour through the 20% of deep learning that will give you 80% of the value

Welcome to this mini-course on Deep learning. Whether you’re just starting out, or, are a seasoned practitioner, I hope you find this valuable to you. There are a gazillion resources out there to teach deep learning. So why another one? One of the biggest impediments I’ve found for people is that they don’t have the time to work through hours of material and secondly, don’t know where to start. This course is focused on solving exactly these problems and more through:

- **A bite sized daily schedule** - No more lack of time excuses.
- **Using** **freely available compute** - No more “I don’t have a fancy GPU” excuse.
- **Learning by Doing** - Remove the inertia of learning theory first. Code what you want to learn.
- Whether you are team Pytorch or team Keras, there are **exercises in both frameworks**. Pick your favorite and run with it.
- **A Mini Project** - For the more enthusiastic practitioners, you’ll have a mini-project to complete to internalize your learnings.
- **Free Resources for Further learning** - Once you start, you’ll want to continue.
